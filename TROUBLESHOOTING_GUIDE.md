# 🔧 Organizational Chart Feature - Troubleshooting Guide

## Problem Resolution Summary

The original issue was **memory exhaustion** when processing large Excel files (154,000+ rows). Here's what was fixed:

## ✅ **Issues Fixed:**

### 1. **Memory Management**
- **Problem**: Node.js running out of heap memory with large datasets
- **Solution**: 
  - Increased memory limit to 8GB (`--max-old-space-size=8192`)
  - Added memory monitoring and garbage collection
  - Limited processing to 50,000 records per batch

### 2. **Infinite Loops & Circular References**
- **Problem**: Orphaned records causing infinite processing loops
- **Solution**: 
  - Added circular reference detection
  - Limited orphan node processing
  - Implemented depth limiting (max 10 levels)

### 3. **API Connection Issues**
- **Problem**: Proxy errors and 404 responses  
- **Solution**: 
  - Added proper proxy configuration in package.json
  - Enhanced error handling with timeouts
  - Added memory cleanup after processing

### 4. **UI Performance**
- **Problem**: Too many positions causing UI slowdown
- **Solution**: 
  - Limited positions per node to 50
  - Limited children per node to 20
  - Added progress indicators

## 🚀 **How to Use - Updated Instructions:**

### **For Development (Both servers running):**

1. **Terminal 1 - Start Express API Server:**
   ```bash
   cd "c:\Folder Project\Ai_Position_Skill"
   npm run server
   ```
   ✅ Should see: "🚀 HRAI server is running on port 3050"

2. **Terminal 2 - Start React Dev Server:**
   ```bash
   cd "c:\Folder Project\Ai_Position_Skill" 
   npm run dev
   ```
   ✅ Should see: "webpack compiled successfully"

3. **Access the Application:**
   - 🌐 **React Dev Server**: http://localhost:3000/mining-hr
   - 🔄 **API calls automatically proxy** to port 3050

### **For Production (Single server):**
```bash
npm run prod
# Then access: http://localhost:3050
```

## 📊 **File Size Guidelines:**

| File Size | Records | Status | Recommendation |
|-----------|---------|--------|----------------|
| < 5MB | < 10k | ✅ Fast | Recommended for testing |
| 5-25MB | 10k-50k | ⚡ Good | Processes in 30-60 seconds |
| 25-50MB | 50k-100k | ⚠️ Slow | May take 2-5 minutes |
| > 50MB | > 100k | 🚨 Risk | Consider splitting the file |

## 🔍 **Testing Your Implementation:**

### **Step 1: Test Sample Data**
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/mining-hr
2. Click "Org Chart Visualization" 
3. Select "Sample Data" tab
4. Click "Load Sample Data"
5. ✅ Should see interactive hierarchy

### **Step 2: Test Small CSV**
1. Use the test file: `test_org_data.csv` (included in project)
2. Select "File Upload" tab
3. Upload the test CSV
4. ✅ Should process in < 5 seconds

### **Step 3: Test Your Large File**
1. Start with a smaller subset (first 10,000 rows)
2. Export from Excel as CSV for better performance
3. Upload via "File Upload" tab
4. Monitor server console for progress

## 🚨 **Common Issues & Solutions:**

### **Issue: "Proxy error: Could not proxy request"**
**Cause**: Express server not running or wrong port  
**Solution**: 
```bash
# Restart Express server
npm run server
# Verify it shows "port 3050"
```

### **Issue: "JavaScript heap out of memory"**
**Cause**: File too large for current memory limits  
**Solutions**:
1. **Split your Excel file** into smaller chunks (< 50MB each)
2. **Convert to CSV** format (more memory efficient)
3. **Filter data** before export (remove unnecessary columns/rows)
4. **Increase memory further** if needed:
   ```json
   // In package.json, change server script to:
   "server": "node --max-old-space-size=16384 server.js"
   ```

### **Issue: Processing takes too long (>5 minutes)**
**Cause**: Complex hierarchy with many circular references  
**Solutions**:
1. **Clean your data** - remove circular parent-child relationships
2. **Export by department** - process departments separately
3. **Use the sample data** to verify functionality first

### **Issue: Visualization doesn't show**
**Cause**: Data processing succeeded but hierarchy is empty  
**Check**:
1. Browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Server console for "✅ Successfully processed" message
3. Data format matches required columns

## 📋 **Data Validation Checklist:**

Before uploading large files, verify your Excel/CSV has:

- [x] **Required Columns** (case-insensitive):
  - Object ID / ObjectID  
  - Object Description / Description
  - Object Type / Type
  - Parent Relationship Obj ID / Parent ID
  - Relationship (Text) (optional)
  - Relationship Obj (Text) (optional)

- [x] **Clean Data**:
  - No completely empty rows
  - Object IDs are unique
  - Parent IDs reference existing Object IDs
  - Object Type contains 'O' (Organization) or 'S' (Staff/Position)

- [x] **Reasonable Size**:
  - File size under 50MB
  - Row count under 100,000 for optimal performance

## 🔧 **Advanced Configuration:**

### **For Very Large Organizations (500k+ records):**

1. **Increase Memory Limit:**
   ```json
   "server": "node --max-old-space-size=32768 server.js"
   ```

2. **Modify Processing Limits** in `orgChartParser.js`:
   ```javascript
   const MAX_RECORDS = 100000; // Increase from 50,000
   const MAX_ORPHANS = 500;    // Increase from 100
   ```

3. **Consider Database Integration** for enterprise-scale data

## 💡 **Performance Tips:**

1. **CSV > Excel**: CSV files process ~3x faster than Excel
2. **Clean Data**: Remove unused columns before export  
3. **Departmental Processing**: Split large orgs by department
4. **Progressive Loading**: Start with top 3-4 hierarchy levels
5. **Regular Cleanup**: Restart servers after processing large files

## 🎯 **Success Indicators:**

✅ **Everything Working When You See:**
- Express server: "🚀 HRAI server is running on port 3050"
- React server: "webpack compiled successfully"  
- Upload: "✅ Successfully processed X records"
- Visualization: Interactive org chart with expandable nodes
- Performance: Sample data loads in < 5 seconds

## 📞 **Still Having Issues?**

1. **Check both server logs** for detailed error messages
2. **Try the sample data first** to verify basic functionality
3. **Test with the included `test_org_data.csv`** 
4. **Gradually increase file sizes** to find your system's limits
5. **Monitor memory usage** in Task Manager during processing
